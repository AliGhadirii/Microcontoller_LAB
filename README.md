# Microcontoller_LAB  :smiley:  
**Note: If you are an IUT student and currently has this lab, please first try to answer the questions by yourself. Then check with mine.**  
 ## Requirements:
 - CodeVision. In case you are unfamiliar with CodeVision, please take a look at [the video](https://github.com/GhazaleZe/Microcontoller_LAB/blob/main/start_codevision.rar) that I recorded in Persian.  
 - Proteus 8.9 Professional
 ## Programming Language:
 C.  
## Notes:
 - note1: The proteus folder contains hex files, screenshots, or a short video, and proteus files.  
 - note2: From LAB02 having separate header files and c files are important, so they are placed in **source**.  
 - note3: **ATmega16** is the AVR used in this Microcontoller_LAB.  
 ## LAB 01: Input and Output
This session contains 6 questions in the main file.   
All C codes are in Lab01.c. 
## LAB 02: Subroutines
The main is in the S02.c file but questions functions are in the source file. 
## LAB 03: Character LCD, Matrix keyboard, Interrupts  
For the keypad notice how columns and rows are connected.  
## LAB 04: LCD interrupts and timers   
The main is in the S04.c file but questions functions are in the source file.  
## LAB 05: Electric motors  
The main is in the s05.c file but questions functions are in the source file.  
## LAB 06: Analog to digital converter  
The main is in the s06.c file but questions functions are in the source file. 
## LAB 07: UART  
Questions are in files named 2 to 5. The final one is 5.   
## LAB 08: Graphic LCD and Dot Matrix 
The main is in the s08.c file but questions functions are in the source file.   
There is a short movie in the *watchme4* file from the final output.
